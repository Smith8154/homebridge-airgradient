# Homebridge AirGradient

This plugin allows you to display the air quality values from your AirGradient devices in HomeKit.

### Features

 - Add a single AirGradient device into HomeKit
 - Reporting values for PM 2.5, PM 10, TVOC, and NOx (HomeKit currently does not support any of the other sensors on AirGradient devices)
 - Supports multiple AirGradient devices

### Planned Features

 - Reporting of hardware details (manufacturer, serial number, and model) into HomeKit

### Contributing

Please feel free to contribute to this project in any way you see fit. If there are any features you would like, please open an issue and I will see what I can do. If you want to help clean up or optimize the code, feel free to open a PR. I do not know TypeScript at all, I just know that this works.
